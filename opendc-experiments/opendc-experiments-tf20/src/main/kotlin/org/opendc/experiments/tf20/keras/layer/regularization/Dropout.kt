/**
 * This layer applies dropout to the input.
 *
 * Dropout consists in randomly setting a fraction `rate` of input units to 0
 * at each update during training time, which helps prevent overfitting.
 * The units that are kept are scaled by `1 / (1 - rate)`, so that their
 * sum is unchanged at training time and inference time.
 *
 * @property keepProbability The dropout rate, between 0 and 1. E.g. `rate=0.1` would drop out 10% of input units.
 * @property [name] Custom layer name.
