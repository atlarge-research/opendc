# Installation

This page describes how to set up and configure a local single-user OpenDC installation so that you can quickly get your
experiments running. You can also use the [hosted version of OpenDC](https://app.opendc.org) to get started even
quicker (The web server is however missing some more complex features).


## Prerequisites

1. **Supported Platforms**  
   OpenDC is actively tested on Windows, macOS and GNU/Linux.
2. **Required Software**  
   A Java installation of version 19 or higher is required for OpenDC. You may download the
   [Java distribution from Oracle](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/) or use the distribution provided
   by your package manager.

## Download

To get an OpenDC distribution, download a recent version from our [Releases](https://github.com/atlarge-research/opendc/releases) page on GitHub.
For basic usage, the OpenDCExperimentRunner is all that is needed.

## Setup

Unpack the downloaded OpenDC distribution. Opening OpenDCExperimentRunner results in two folders, `bin` and `lib`. 
`lib` contains all `.jar` files needed to run OpenDC. `bin` two executable versions of the OpenDCExperimentRunner. 
In the following pages, we discuss how to run an experiment using the executables.
