# Installation

This page describes how to set up and configure a local single-user OpenDC installation so that you can quickly get your
experiments running. You can also use the [hosted version of OpenDC](https://app.opendc.org) to get started even
quicker.


## Prerequisites

1. **Supported Platforms**  
   OpenDC is actively tested on Windows, macOS and GNU/Linux.
2. **Required Software**  
   A Java installation of version 17 or higher is required for OpenDC. You may download the
   [Java distribution from Oracle](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/) or use the distribution provided
   by your package manager.

## Download

To get an OpenDC distribution, download a recent version from our [Releases](https://github.com/atlarge-research/opendc/releases)
page on GitHub.

## Setup

Unpack the downloaded OpenDC distribution and try the following command:

```bash
$ bin/opendc-server

```
This will launch the built-in single-user OpenDC server on port 8080. Visit
[http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) to access the bundled web UI.

## Configuration

OpenDC can be configured using the configuration files located in the `conf` directory. By default, all user data is
stored in the `data` directory using the H2 database engine.

## Multi-tenant deployment

For more information on setting up multi-tenant, non-trivial deployments, see the [Deployment Guide](docs/advanced-guides/deploy.md).
