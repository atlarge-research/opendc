The topology of a datacenter is defined using a JSON file. A topology consist of one or more clusters.
Each cluster consist of at least one host on which jobs can be executed. Each host consist of one or more CPUs,
a memory unit and a power model.

## Schema

The schema for the topology file is provided in [schema](TopologySchema).
In the following section, we describe the different components of the schema.

## Examples

In the following section, we discuss several examples of topology files. Any topology file can be verified using the
JSON schema defined in [schema](TopologySchema).

### Simple

The simplest data center that can be provided to OpenDC is shown below:

```json
{
    "clusters": [
        {
            "hosts": [
                {
                    "cpus": [
                        {
                            "coreCount": 16,
                            "coreSpeed": 1000
                        }
                    ],
                    "memory": {
                        "memorySize": 100000
                    }
                }
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```

This is creates a data center with a single cluster containing a single host. This host consist of a single 16 core CPU
with a speed of 1 Ghz, and 100 MiB RAM memory.

### Count

Duplicating clusters, hosts, or CPUs is easy using the "count" keyword:

```json
{
    "clusters": [
        {
            "count": 2,
            "hosts": [
                {
                    "count": 5,
                    "cpus": [
                        {
                            "coreCount": 16,
                            "coreSpeed": 1000,
                            "count": 10
                        }
                    ],
                    "memory": {
                        "memorySize": 100000
                    }
                }
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```

This topology creates a datacenter consisting of 2 clusters, both containing 5 hosts. Each host contains 10 16 core
CPUs.
Using "count" saves a lot of copying.

### Complex

Following is an example of a more complex topology:

```json
{
    "clusters": [
        {
            "name": "C01",
            "count": 2,
            "hosts": [
                {
                    "name": "H01",
                    "count": 2,
                    "cpus": [
                        {
                            "coreCount": 16,
                            "coreSpeed": 1000
                        }
                    ],
                    "memory": {
                        "memorySize": 1000000
                    },
                    "powerModel": {
                        "modelType": "linear",
                        "idlePower": 200.0,
                        "maxPower": 400.0
                    }
                },
                {
                    "name": "H02",
                    "count": 2,
                    "cpus": [
                        {
                            "coreCount": 8,
                            "coreSpeed": 3000
                        }
                    ],
                    "memory": {
                        "memorySize": 100000
                    },
                    "powerModel": {
                        "modelType": "square",
                        "idlePower": 300.0,
                        "maxPower": 500.0
                    }
                }
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```

This topology defines two types of hosts with different coreCount, and coreSpeed.
Both types of hosts are created twice.
