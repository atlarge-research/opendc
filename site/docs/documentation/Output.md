Running OpenDC results in three output files. The first file ([Server](#server)) contains metrics related to the jobs being executed. 
The second file ([Host](#host)) contains all metrics related to the hosts on which jobs can be executed. Finally, the third file ([Service](#service))
contains metrics describing the overall performance. An experiment in OpenDC has
