Running OpenDC results in three output files. The first file ([Task](#task)) contains metrics related to the jobs being executed. 
The second file ([Host](#host)) contains all metrics related to the hosts on which jobs can be executed. The third file ([Power](#power))
contains all metrics related to the power sources that power the hosts. Finally, the third file ([Service](#service))
contains metrics describing the overall performance. An experiment in OpenDC has
