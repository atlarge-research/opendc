Running OpenDC results in five output files: 
1. [Task](#task) contains metrics related to the jobs being executed.
2. [Host](#host) contains all metrics related to the hosts on which jobs can be executed.
3. [Power Source](#power-source) contains all metrics related to the power sources that power the hosts.
4. [Battery](#battery) contains all metrics related to the batteries that power the hosts.
5. [Service](#service) contains metrics describing the overall performance.

User can define which files, and features are to be included in the output in the experiment file (see [ExportModel](/docs/documentation/Input/ExportModel.md)).
