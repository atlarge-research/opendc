    "Because they are getting their energy from different sources, their carbon emission is different. This demo is based on the work done for the workshop paper `FootPrinter: Quantifying Data Center Carbon Footprint` which can found [here](https://atlarge-research.com/pdfs/2024-hotcloud-footprinter.pdf).\n",

    "## 1. Carbon Footprint\n",
    "\n",
    "With the rise of high-computational workloads, such as Artificial Intelligence, datacenters are using a lot of energy. Because of this datacenters have become increasingly large contributors to the global footprint. A common definition of the carbon footprint of a datacenter is its total carbon emissions. In this demo, we are looking at the operational carbon emission of a datacenter. Operational carbon is all carbon that is emitted when producing the energy required to run a workload. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Carbon Intensity\n",
    "Determining the operational carbon emission of a datacenter requires more than just the energy used. Equally important is the source of the energy. Using energy from non-green sources, such as coal, can emit up to 20x times as much carbon as green energy, such as solar. Carbon Intensity defines the amount of carbon emitted per unit of energy. Multiplying the energy usage of the energy by the carbon intensity of the energy source determines the carbon emission.   \n",
    "\n",
    "Green energy is primarily gained from natural phenomena, such as wind or sunlight. This results in a continuously changing mix of available energy. This means the carbon intensity, even at the same location, is rarely stable over a long period of time. Below, we see the carbon intensity of the Dutch energy grid during a period of a week:\n",

    "Figure taken from  [FootPrinter](https://atlarge-research.com/pdfs/2024-hotcloud-footprinter.pdf\")\n",
    "\n",
    "Due to the fluctuating availability of green energy (the Netherlands relies on solar and wind) there is a large variation in carbon intensity over time. This shows that to reduce the carbon emissions it is not just important to reduce energy usage, but also when and where tasks are executed."
